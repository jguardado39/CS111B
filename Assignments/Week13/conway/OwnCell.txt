I acutally made two different classes

1. HowManyNeighbors
2. RandomColony

For HowManyNeighbors it basically reqiures a row, column, and a CowayWorld class in 
order to use one cell to count the number of neighbors it has adjacent. 
Example
. . .                 0 0 0
. 0 . =============>  0 8 0
. . .                 0 0 0

This cell will be a pernament-always on cell so when they have an adjacent cell it 
will count.


For RandomColony will randomly place a cell(s) depending on how long you will like
for loop added to the grid. These always stay alive for now :) 

UPDATE (12/1)
WIth the new update on the class it will randomly add a colony on the grid and use the 
same logic as ConwayCell for alive for next generation.
